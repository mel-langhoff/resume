    A terminal-based Ruby implementation of the classic Battleship game. Developed with a partner,
    this project required:

    - Careful coordination and clear communication to handle the complexity of the game's logic.
    - Developing a user-friendly interface for placing ships and taking turns guessing.
    - Ensuring the game logic correctly handles wins, losses, and invalid moves.

    The game allows two players to place ships and take turns guessing the locations of their
    opponent's ships until one player sinks all the ships.
